Why I chose this project? One of my favorite flash games as a kid was the game snake, so I figured I'd make it for my second posted project. Before this I had limited experience with html/javascript/css but I now feel much more confident with each.

Most challenging parts? Figuring out how the game-play will work and deciding upon a set style

Areas of improvement? More extensions (Hazards, progressive difficulty, etc.) change style, possibly a spectate mode (Snake travels by itself)
